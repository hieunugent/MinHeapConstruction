# MinHeapConstruction 
-implement Min Heap class that supports:
  - building a min heap from an input array of integers
  - inserting integers in the heap
  - Removing the heap's  mininum / root value
  - peeking at the heap's minimum / root value
  - sifting integers up and down the heap, which is to be used when inserting and removing value
- type of heap is array
- the heap is binary tree and complete exceptional last level
- min heap the  root is minimum value of heap
- in the array representation 
  - currentnode index i
  - childOne index i*2 +1
  - childTwo index i*2 +2
- the good thing about heap we can find parent from current node 
  - by rounding down result of (index -1)/2 
- order of function should build
  - insert shirt up
  - remove shirt down
  - build 
  - other
