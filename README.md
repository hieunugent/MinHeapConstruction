# MinHeapConstruction 
-implement Min Heap class that supports:
  - building a min heap from an input array of integers
  - inserting integers in the heap
  - Removing the heap's  mininum / root value
  - peeking at the heap's minimum / root value
  - sifting integers up and down the heap, which is to be used when inserting and removing value
- type of heap is array
- the heap is binary tree and complete exceptional last level
- min heap the  root is minimum value of heap
- in the array representation 
  - currentnode index i
  - childOne index i*2 +1
  - childTwo index i*2 +2
- the good thing about heap we can find parent from current node 
  - by rounding down result of (index -1)/2 
- order of function should build
  - insert sirtup
      - sirtUp: 
        - look for idx of the parent node then compare the current idx value with parent node value if current is smaller is move up,
        - replace the current idx by parent idx back to previuos line by loop
        - else do notthing
      - insert:
        - insert the new value at the end of array
        - call sirtUp  at the current idex
  - remove sirt down
      - sirtDown:
        - to be able move down the current value must less then the child when call
        - identify the child node idx, compare two child node value if posible
        - the only child has smaller value will be on the swap pos
        - if the value is smaller than parent swap , otherwise do nothing
        - if can swap update the index if current idx to the 
      - remove:
        - swap the value fo zero index with the last index
        - call remove function for the last index
        - call the siftdown for the value that just swap
  - build 
        - choose the start index with the mid index value, 
        - call the move down fuction , at current index
        - reduce index by one start the second step until index in less than zero
        - re turen 
  - other
        - swap helper function
